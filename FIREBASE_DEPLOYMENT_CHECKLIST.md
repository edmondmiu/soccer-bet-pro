# Firebase Deployment Verification Checklist

This checklist ensures that all modular structure and pause system functionality works correctly on Firebase hosting after deployment.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Code Structure Verification
- [ ] All inline JavaScript has been extracted to `scripts/main.js`
- [ ] Game HTML uses `<script type="module" src="scripts/main.js"></script>`
- [ ] All required modules are in `scripts/` directory:
  - [ ] `main.js` (main game module)
  - [ ] `pauseManager.js` (pause system core)
  - [ ] `pauseUI.js` (pause UI components)
  - [ ] `gameState.js` (game state management)
  - [ ] `betting.js` (betting logic)
  - [ ] `gameLogic.js` (match simulation)
  - [ ] `ui.js` (UI utilities)
  - [ ] `utils.js` (utility functions)

### 2. Pause System Integration
- [ ] `main.js` imports `pauseManager` and `pauseUI`
- [ ] `processMatchEvent()` includes `isBettingEvent()` check
- [ ] All betting events trigger `pauseManager.pauseGame()`
- [ ] Betting decision handlers call `pauseManager.resumeGame()`
- [ ] Pause overlay HTML is present in game template

### 3. File Synchronization
- [ ] Root `game_prototype.html` matches `public/game_prototype.html`
- [ ] All `scripts/*` files copied to `public/scripts/`
- [ ] All `styles/*` files copied to `public/styles/`
- [ ] Any new test files copied to `public/tests/` if needed

## Deployment Commands

```bash
# 1. Sync files to public directory
cp game_prototype.html public/game_prototype.html
cp -r scripts/* public/scripts/
cp -r styles/* public/styles/

# 2. Deploy to Firebase
firebase deploy --only hosting

# 3. Verify deployment
firebase hosting:channel:list
```

## Post-Deployment Verification

### 1. Automated Tests
Run the following automated tests to verify deployment:

```bash
# Basic deployment verification
node tests/firebase-deployment-verification.js

# Betting events validation
node tests/firebase-betting-events-validation.js
```

### 2. Manual Browser Testing
Open the browser-based validation test:
- Navigate to `tests/firebase-pause-system-validation.html`
- Click "Start Validation Tests"
- Verify all tests pass

### 3. Live Game Testing
Test the actual game on Firebase:

#### Access Points
- **Main Game**: https://soccer-bet-pro.web.app/game
- **Direct HTML**: https://soccer-bet-pro.web.app/game_prototype.html
- **Home Page**: https://soccer-bet-pro.web.app/

#### Test Scenarios
- [ ] **Game Loading**: Game loads without console errors
- [ ] **Module Loading**: No "module not found" errors in console
- [ ] **Pause System**: Pause overlay appears during betting events
- [ ] **Betting Events**: All betting opportunities trigger pause
- [ ] **Resume Functionality**: Game resumes correctly after betting decisions
- [ ] **Countdown Animation**: 3-second countdown works properly
- [ ] **Mobile Compatibility**: Game works on mobile devices

### 4. Performance Verification
- [ ] **Load Time**: Game loads within 3 seconds
- [ ] **Module Loading**: No significant delays loading ES6 modules
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: No memory leaks during extended gameplay
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if modules fail to load

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Module Loading Issues
**Problem**: "Failed to resolve module specifier" errors
**Solution**: 
- Verify all import paths use relative paths (`./moduleName.js`)
- Ensure all files have `.js` extension in imports
- Check Firebase hosting serves JS files with correct MIME type

### Pause System Not Working
**Problem**: Betting events don't trigger pause
**Solution**:
- Verify `isBettingEvent()` function is present in `main.js`
- Check that `processMatchEvent()` calls pause system
- Ensure pause system modules are properly imported

### CSS/Styling Issues
**Problem**: Game styling broken on Firebase
**Solution**:
- Verify all CSS files are in `public/styles/`
- Check that HTML references correct CSS paths
- Ensure Firebase serves CSS with correct MIME type

### Mobile Compatibility Issues
**Problem**: Game doesn't work on mobile
**Solution**:
- Test responsive design on various screen sizes
- Verify touch events work for betting interactions
- Check that modals display correctly on small screens

## Rollback Procedure

If deployment issues occur:

1. **Immediate Rollback**:
   ```bash
   firebase hosting:channel:deploy --expires 1h previous-version
   ```

2. **Fix and Redeploy**:
   - Identify and fix the issue
   - Run pre-deployment checklist
   - Test locally before redeploying
   - Deploy with verification

## Success Criteria

Deployment is considered successful when:
- [ ] All automated tests pass (100% success rate)
- [ ] Manual browser testing shows no errors
- [ ] Live game testing confirms all functionality works
- [ ] Performance metrics meet requirements
- [ ] Mobile compatibility verified

## Maintenance Notes

### Regular Checks
- Run automated tests monthly
- Verify game functionality after Firebase updates
- Monitor performance metrics
- Check for new browser compatibility issues

### Update Process
1. Make changes to root files
2. Run local tests
3. Follow this checklist for deployment
4. Verify deployment success
5. Update documentation if needed
