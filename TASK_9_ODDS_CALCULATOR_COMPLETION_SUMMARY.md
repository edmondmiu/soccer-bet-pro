# Task 9: OddsCalculator Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

## 📋 Task Overview
**Task:** Create OddsCalculator for dynamic odds
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED
**Requirements:** 6.3, 1.3

## 🎯 Implementation Summary

### ✅ Core Features Implemented

1. **OddsCalculator.js** - Main calculator module
   - Initial odds generation (Home 1.85, Draw 3.50, Away 4.20)
   - Goal-based odds recalculation algorithm
   - Real-time odds adjustments based on match state
   - Odds validation and bounds checking (1.10 - 15.00)
   - Precision rounding to 2 decimal places

2. **Dynamic Odds Adjustments**
   - Home goal: Home odds ↓ (×0.85), Draw/Away odds ↑ (×1.15/×1.25)
   - Away goal: Away odds ↓ (×0.85), Home/Draw odds ↑ (×1.25/×1.15)
   - Cumulative adjustments for multiple goals
   - Automatic bounds enforcement

3. **Odds Update Triggers**
   - Goal events trigger odds recalculation
   - Non-goal events (commentary, etc.) don't trigger updates
   - Efficient event filtering system

4. **Validation & Error Handling**
   - Input validation for match states
   - Odds structure validation
   - Bounds checking and enforcement
   - Graceful error handling with descriptive messages

### 🧪 Testing Implementation

1. **Comprehensive Test Suite** (`OddsCalculator.test.js`)
   - 17 unit tests covering all functionality
   - Edge case testing (large numbers, negative values, etc.)
   - Error handling verification
   - Performance validation

2. **Browser Test Runner** (`odds-calculator-test-runner.html`)
   - Interactive web-based testing interface
   - Live odds demonstration with different match scenarios
   - Performance benchmarking tools
   - Visual odds analysis and probability display

3. **Node.js Test Runner** (`test-odds-calculator-node.js`)
   - Command-line testing with detailed progress reporting
   - Memory usage analysis
   - Performance benchmarking (50,000 iterations)
   - Edge case validation

4. **Requirements Verification** (`verify-odds-calculator-requirements.js`)
   - Explicit verification of requirements 6.3 and 1.3
   - Compliance checking for all specified features
   - Performance requirements validation

### 🔧 Key Methods & Features

#### Core Calculation Methods
- `getInitialOdds()` - Returns initial odds (1.85, 3.50, 4.20)
- `calculateOdds(matchState)` - Main odds calculation with goal adjustments
- `adjustForGoal(team, currentOdds)` - Single goal adjustment logic
- `shouldUpdateOdds(event)` - Event-based update triggers

#### Utility Methods
- `validateOdds(odds)` - Odds structure and bounds validation
- `applyOddsBounds(odds)` - Enforce min/max bounds (1.10 - 15.00)
- `roundOdds(odds)` - Round to 2 decimal places
- `getImpliedProbability(odds)` - Convert odds to probability percentage

#### Analysis Methods
- `calculateOddsChange(oldOdds, newOdds)` - Percentage change calculation
- `getOddsSummary(odds)` - Complete odds analysis with probabilities

### 🎮 Usage Examples

```javascript
import { oddsCalculator } from './src/utils/OddsCalculator.js';

// Get initial odds
const initialOdds = oddsCalculator.getInitialOdds();
// { home: 1.85, draw: 3.50, away: 4.20 }

// Calculate odds for 1-0 match
const matchOdds = oddsCalculator.calculateOdds({ homeScore: 1, awayScore: 0 });
// { home: 1.57, draw: 4.03, away: 5.25 } (example values)

// Check if event should trigger update
const shouldUpdate = oddsCalculator.shouldUpdateOdds({ type: 'GOAL' });
// true

// Get odds summary with probabilities
const summary = oddsCalculator.getOddsSummary(matchOdds);
// { odds: {...}, probabilities: {...}, totalProbability: 108.33 }
```

### 🔗 Integration Points

The OddsCalculator integrates with:
- **EventManager** - Receives goal events for odds updates
