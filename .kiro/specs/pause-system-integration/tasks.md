# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Extract inline JavaScript from game_prototype.html to scripts/main.js

  - Create new scripts/main.js file with ES6 module structure
  - Extract all game functions from inline script tags in game_prototype.html
  - Convert functions to proper ES6 exports and class methods
  - Preserve all existing functionality including state management and event handling
  - Write unit tests to verify extracted functions work identically to inline versions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 5.1_

- [x] 2. Update HTML to use modular script structure

  - Replace inline script tags with `<script type="module" src="scripts/main.js">`
  - Ensure all DOM element references work correctly with module structure
  - Update any global variable references to work with module scope
  - Test that HTML loads and initializes the modular game correctly
  - Write integration tests for HTML-module interaction
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.5, 5.4_

- [x] 3. Import and initialize existing pause system modules

  - Add proper ES6 imports for pauseManager and pauseUI in scripts/main.js
  - Create initialization sequence for pause system modules
  - Connect pause system to existing game state management
  - Handle module import errors gracefully with fallback behavior
  - Write tests for module loading and initialization
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 5.2_

- [x] 4. Create centralized betting event detection system

  - Implement isBettingEvent() function to identify events that require pause
  - Create EVENT_CLASSIFICATIONS constant with betting vs non-betting events
  - Design extensible system for adding new betting event types
  - Add logic to automatically pause for any event that shows betting UI
  - Write unit tests for event classification and detection
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [x] 5. Enhance processMatchEvent with automatic pause triggers

  - Update processMatchEvent() to check for betting events before processing
  - Add pauseManager.pauseGame() call for all detected betting events
  - Ensure pause triggers before any betting UI is displayed
  - Maintain existing event processing logic for all event types
  - Write integration tests for event processing with pause triggers
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4, 6.4, 6.5_

- [x] 6. Integrate pause system with betting decision handlers

  - Update showMultiChoiceActionBet() to work with pre-triggered pause
  - Add pauseManager.resumeGame() calls to all betting decision handlers
  - Ensure resume triggers after bet placement, skip, or timeout
  - Connect existing betting modals with pause system countdown
  - Write tests for betting decision flow with pause integration
  - _Requirements: 2.5, 3.4, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 7. Implement consistent pause behavior across all betting scenarios

  - Ensure full-match betting also triggers pause when appropriate
  - Add pause support for any future betting event types
  - Handle multiple betting events with proper sequencing
  - Maintain classic mode compatibility with pause system
  - Write comprehensive tests for all betting scenarios
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.4, 4.5, 6.5_

- [x] 8. Add comprehensive error handling and fallbacks

  - Handle module import failures with graceful degradation
  - Add error handling for pause system initialization failures
  - Implement fallback behavior if pause system fails during gameplay
  - Add logging and debugging support for troubleshooting
  - Write tests for error scenarios and recovery mechanisms
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 5.1, 5.4_

- [x] 9. Create comprehensive test suite for integration validation

  - Write side-by-side comparison tests between inline and modular versions
  - Create integration tests for pause system with all betting events
  - Add regression tests to ensure no functionality is lost
  - Test module loading and initialization in different environments
  - Write end-to-end tests for complete game flow with pause system
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5_

- [x] 10. Deploy and validate on Firebase hosting
  - Update Firebase deployment to include new modular structure
  - Test module loading and ES6 imports work correctly on Firebase
  - Validate pause system works identically on hosted version
  - Perform comprehensive testing of all betting events with pause
  - Create deployment verification checklist for future updates
  - _Requirements: 5.4, 5.5_
