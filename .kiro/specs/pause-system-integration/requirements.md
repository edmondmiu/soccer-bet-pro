# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature properly integrates the existing modular pause system with the main game by converting the inline JavaScript to ES6 modules and ensuring ALL betting events trigger the pause system. This fixes the current issue where only multi-choice action bets pause the game, while other betting opportunities do not.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the main game to use proper ES6 module structure, so that it can integrate with the existing modular pause system components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting the main game THEN the system SHALL extract all inline JavaScript from game_prototype.html into scripts/main.js
2. WHEN creating the module THEN the system SHALL use proper ES6 import/export syntax for all game functions
3. WHEN updating the HTML THEN the system SHALL use `<script type="module" src="scripts/main.js">` instead of inline scripts
4. WHEN the conversion is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain 100% of existing game functionality
5. WHEN testing the modular version THEN the system SHALL work identically to the inline version

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to pause for ALL betting opportunities, so that I never miss a chance to place a bet regardless of the event type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any betting event occurs THEN the system SHALL pause the game using the existing pause system
2. WHEN a MULTI_CHOICE_ACTION_BET event occurs THEN the system SHALL pause the game and show betting modal
3. WHEN any future betting event type is added THEN the system SHALL automatically pause the game
4. WHEN the game is paused THEN the system SHALL stop the match timer and show pause overlay
5. WHEN a betting decision is made THEN the system SHALL resume the game with countdown

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the pause system modules to be properly imported and initialized, so that all pause functionality works correctly in the main game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the main game starts THEN the system SHALL import pauseManager and pauseUI modules
2. WHEN importing modules THEN the system SHALL handle any import errors gracefully
3. WHEN initializing pause system THEN the system SHALL connect it to the existing game state
4. WHEN pause system is active THEN the system SHALL use the existing pause overlay and countdown UI
5. WHEN integrating modules THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing pause system features

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want consistent pause behavior across all betting scenarios, so that the game experience is predictable and fair.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any betting modal appears THEN the system SHALL pause the game immediately
2. WHEN the betting modal is dismissed THEN the system SHALL resume the game with 3-second countdown
3. WHEN betting times out THEN the system SHALL auto-resume after the timeout period
4. WHEN multiple betting events occur THEN the system SHALL handle them sequentially without conflicts
5. WHEN classic mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL still pause for full-match betting opportunities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing to ensure the integration works correctly, so that no functionality is broken during the conversion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the integration THEN the system SHALL verify all game functions work identically
2. WHEN testing pause functionality THEN the system SHALL verify pause triggers for all betting events
3. WHEN testing module loading THEN the system SHALL verify proper import/export functionality
4. WHEN testing in different environments THEN the system SHALL work on both local and Firebase hosting
5. WHEN testing is complete THEN the system SHALL have no regressions from the original inline version

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the processMatchEvent function to automatically pause for any betting-related event, so that future betting features automatically get pause support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processMatchEvent encounters a betting event THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger pause
2. WHEN adding new betting event types THEN the system SHALL not require manual pause integration
3. WHEN an event shows any betting UI THEN the system SHALL pause the game
4. WHEN an event is purely informational THEN the system SHALL not pause the game
5. WHEN the pause logic is implemented THEN the system SHALL be extensible for future betting features
