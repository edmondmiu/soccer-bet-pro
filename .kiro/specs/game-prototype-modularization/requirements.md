# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current game prototype is implemented as a single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript, making it difficult to maintain, extend, and collaborate on. This feature will modularize the prototype into separate, organized files with clear separation of concerns, improved maintainability, and better development workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the game prototype to be split into separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, so that I can easily navigate and modify specific aspects of the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modularization is complete THEN the system SHALL have separate files for HTML structure, CSS styles, and JavaScript functionality
2. WHEN a developer opens the project THEN the system SHALL maintain the same visual appearance and functionality as the original prototype
3. WHEN the HTML file is loaded THEN the system SHALL properly link to external CSS and JavaScript files

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the JavaScript code to be organized into logical modules, so that I can easily understand and modify specific game features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the JavaScript is modularized THEN the system SHALL separate game state management, UI rendering, game logic, and event handling into distinct modules
2. WHEN a developer needs to modify betting functionality THEN the system SHALL have a dedicated betting module with clear interfaces
3. WHEN a developer needs to update the UI THEN the system SHALL have a separate UI/rendering module
4. WHEN the modules are loaded THEN the system SHALL maintain proper dependency relationships and initialization order

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CSS to be organized into logical sections, so that I can easily find and modify specific styling concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CSS is organized THEN the system SHALL separate base styles, component styles, animations, and responsive design into logical sections
2. WHEN a developer needs to modify animations THEN the system SHALL have a dedicated animations section
3. WHEN a developer needs to update component styling THEN the system SHALL have clearly organized component-specific styles
4. WHEN the CSS is loaded THEN the system SHALL maintain the same visual appearance as the original

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a proper project structure with organized directories, so that I can easily locate and manage different types of files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is restructured THEN the system SHALL have separate directories for assets, styles, scripts, and the main HTML file
2. WHEN a developer looks for JavaScript files THEN the system SHALL have a dedicated scripts/js directory
3. WHEN a developer looks for CSS files THEN the system SHALL have a dedicated styles/css directory
4. WHEN the project structure is complete THEN the system SHALL include a README file explaining the new structure and how to run the project

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the modular code to maintain the same functionality as the original prototype, so that no features are lost during the refactoring process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modularization is complete THEN the system SHALL preserve all original game functionality including lobby, match simulation, betting, and power-ups
2. WHEN a user interacts with the modular version THEN the system SHALL behave identically to the original prototype
3. WHEN the game state changes THEN the system SHALL properly update the UI across all modules
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully without breaking the modular structure

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear module interfaces and documentation, so that I can easily understand how different parts of the system interact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules are created THEN the system SHALL have clear import/export statements defining module boundaries
2. WHEN a developer reviews the code THEN the system SHALL include JSDoc comments explaining key functions and module purposes
3. WHEN modules interact THEN the system SHALL use well-defined interfaces rather than global variables where possible
4. WHEN the documentation is complete THEN the system SHALL include inline comments explaining complex game logic and state management
