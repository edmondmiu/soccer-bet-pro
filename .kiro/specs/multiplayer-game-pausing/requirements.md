# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a game pausing system for the prototype that simulates multiplayer behavior when betting opportunities arise. The system pauses the game during betting events to ensure players don't miss action while making decisions, creating the foundation for future multiplayer functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to pause when betting events occur, so that I have time to make decisions without missing game action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a betting event is triggered THEN the system SHALL pause the game state
2. WHEN the game is paused THEN the system SHALL stop all game timers and animations
3. WHEN the game is paused THEN the system SHALL prevent any game state changes that would affect gameplay
4. WHEN the pause is initiated THEN the system SHALL display appropriate pause indicators
5. WHEN the game is paused THEN the system SHALL maintain all current game state for resumption

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see clear indication that the game is paused and why, so that I understand what's happening and what action is expected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game is paused for betting THEN the system SHALL display a "Game Paused - Betting in Progress" message
2. WHEN the pause message is shown THEN the system SHALL indicate the reason for the pause clearly
3. WHEN the game is paused THEN the system SHALL dim or overlay the game area to indicate inactive state
4. WHEN displaying pause status THEN the system SHALL show a simulated "waiting for players" message for prototype testing
5. WHEN the pause status changes THEN the system SHALL update the display appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to resume automatically when I finish my betting decision, so that gameplay continues smoothly without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player completes their betting decision THEN the system SHALL automatically resume the game
2. WHEN resuming the game THEN the system SHALL provide a 3-second countdown before gameplay continues
3. WHEN the countdown starts THEN the system SHALL display "Resuming in 3... 2... 1..." to the player
4. WHEN the game resumes THEN the system SHALL restore all game timers and animations to their previous state
5. WHEN resuming THEN the system SHALL clear all pause-related UI elements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the system to handle timeout scenarios gracefully, so that the game doesn't get stuck if I don't respond quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a betting pause exceeds 15 seconds THEN the system SHALL automatically resume the game
2. WHEN auto-resuming due to timeout THEN the system SHALL treat the player as having skipped the bet
3. WHEN a timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL display "Timeout - Resuming Game" message
4. IF the player responds after timeout THEN the system SHALL ignore their betting decision for that event
5. WHEN handling timeouts THEN the system SHALL log the event for debugging purposes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the pause system to integrate cleanly with the existing game architecture, so that it doesn't disrupt other game systems and can be easily extended for multiplayer later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the pause system THEN the system SHALL use the existing game state management
2. WHEN pausing THEN the system SHALL preserve all current game state without data loss
3. WHEN resuming THEN the system SHALL restore the exact game state from before the pause
4. WHEN integrating with betting THEN the system SHALL provide clear hooks for betting events to trigger pauses
5. WHEN the pause system is active THEN the system SHALL not interfere with non-gameplay UI elements
